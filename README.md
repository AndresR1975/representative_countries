Analyze the data set of one country: Caribbean Islands and Latin America, choose some relevant variables, choose a representative country, and support why that country is a good choice.

Process:

1. Flag variables with missing values and drop those with more than 45% of missing values.
2. Compare the area with other world areas using the choosen variables.
3. Choose the representative country.
4. Create bar charts to compare the choosen country with other countries from the area.
5. Fill the missing values and identify the outliers for the choosen variables.
6. Analyze the variable variation between countries "using bloxplots as bar charts".
7. Variable correlation analysis.
